Our motivating priorities for this edition are to:

- Make *this* edition a success.
- Do so without requiring heroics from anyone.
    - ...or stressing anyone or everyone out.

Consequently, it's possible that things could change if needed so as to better adhere to those guiding priorities.  This is a project run by volunteers.

However, at the moment, **the edition is on track**.
