# Missing macro fragment specifiers

ðŸš§ The 2024 Edition has not yet been released and hence this section is still "under construction".
More information may be found in the tracking issue at <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/128143>.

## Summary

- The [`missing_fragment_specifier`] lint is now a hard error.

[`missing_fragment_specifier`]: ../../rustc/lints/listing/deny-by-default.html#missing-fragment-specifier

## Details

The [`missing_fragment_specifier`] lint detects a situation when an **unused** pattern in a `macro_rules!` macro definition has a meta-variable (e.g. `$e`) that is not followed by a fragment specifier (e.g. `:expr`). This is now a hard error in the 2024 Edition.

```rust,compile_fail
macro_rules! foo {
   () => {};
   ($name) => { }; // ERROR: missing fragment specifier
}

fn main() {
   foo!();
}
```

If you ever try to call the macro with arguments that would match a rule with a missing specifier, it is a hard error in all editions (for example, calling `foo!($name)` in the example above). However, this check was previously only performed when calling the macro, not when it was defined. A lint was added in Rust 1.17 to look at the *definition* for these missing specifiers.

It was determined that it would cause too much breakage in the ecosystem to make this a hard error in all editions.[^future-incompat]

[^future-incompat]: The lint is marked as a "future-incompatible" warning. It may become a hard error in all editions in a future release. See [#40107] for more information.

## Migration

To migrate your code to the 2024 Edition, remove the unused matcher rule from the macro. The [`missing_fragment_specifier`] lint is on by default in all editions, and should alert you to macros with this issue.

There is no automatic migration for this change. It is expected that this style of macro is extremely rare. The lint has been a future-incompatible lint since Rust 1.17, a deny-by-default lint since Rust 1.20, and warns about dependencies using this pattern since Rust 1.82.
